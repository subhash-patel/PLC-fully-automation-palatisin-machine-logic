Overall Code Workflow:
Basic Start/Stop Logic: Managed by STL. The start button triggers the machine, platform, and VFD to begin operation, with stop and emergency buttons providing reset and halt functionalities.

Platform Control: Controlled by VFD via Modbus. VFD commands are managed using SCL for communication, start, and speed control.

Weighing Feature: The SCL logic ensures data is collected, weighed, and logged for each palletized article, with alarms for discrepancies.

Event and Alarm Handling: Both events (start/stop/weight completion) and alarms (e.g., weight discrepancy, VFD error) are logged in the HMI.

Tower Lamp Logic: The tower lamp indicates machine status (running, stopped, alarm, and weighing complete).

Recipe Management: Operators can load and save recipes that configure palletizing speed, servo positions, and other parameters via the HMI.

21 CFR Compliance: Ensures audit trail logging with timestamps, operator IDs, and electronic signatures for regulatory requirements.

This combination of STL and SCL logic ensures full functionality for your maritime machine with detailed control, automation, and compliance features. Let me know if you'd like to tweak or extend any parts of the code further!
